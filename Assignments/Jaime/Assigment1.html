                    A straightforward example of a good design is the contactless payment symbol. It's very easy to
                    understand and the majority of people who use it in a daily basis
                    won't have any struggles with this. The simplicity and effectiveness of it, makes it a good design.
                    As
                    of improvements, the only small improvement that could be made
                    was to shrink a little bit the "signal waves" and enlarge the card.

                <p>
                    Apple's most recent mouse, Magic Mouse, has a very bad design. Nowadays, with the most of our
                    devices, we can simply grab and use them while they're being charged.
                    Taking a look at the picture, we can see that the mouse can't be used while it's charging, since we
                    need to
                    have the mouse resting in a flat position, it's impossible to use it.
                    An easy solution to fix this problem, is to simply move the port to the front of the mouse. Doing
                    this, we can now charge and use it at the same time.
