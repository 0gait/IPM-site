        <h2 style="color:green"> Good example </h2>
        <p>
        A straightforward example of a good design is the contactless payment symbol. It's very easy to understand and the majority of people who use it in a daily basis
        won't have any struggles with this. The simplicity and effectiveness of it, makes it a good design. As of improvements, the only small improvement that could be made 
        was to shrink a little bit the "signal waves" and enlarge the card.

        <h2 style="color:red"> Bad example </h2>
        <p> 
        Apple's most recent mouse, Magic Mouse, has a very bad design. Nowadays, with the most of our devices, we can simply grab and use them while they're being charged.
        Taking a look below, we can see that the mouse can't be used while it's charging, since we need to have the mouse resting in a flat position, it's impossible to use it.
        An easy solution to fix this problem, is to simply move the port to the front of the mouse. Doing this, we can now charge and use it at the same time.
