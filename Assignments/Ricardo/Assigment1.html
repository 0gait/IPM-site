                    The purpose of this interface is ticket validation. This is an example of good design for several
                    reasons,
                    firstly because the validation place is represented as a "target", being complemented by the
                    information
                    "Valide aqui" (although there is a possibility that not everyone can read the message but, as I
                    said, it's
                    just an add-on). Another reason is the confirmation lights that allow passengers to confirm the
                    success of
                    the operation. As for possible improvements, the "target" lines could stand out a little bit more
                    and the
                    top part be yellow so that only the "target" is in black.

                <p>
                    For bad design, I chose the wire that allows to lower and raise the curtain. It has a problem that
                    everyone
                    recognizes, when we use it, it is always by trial and error since there is nothing in the wires or in
                    the
                    piece that hides the wires, that allows us to know which of the threads allows the curtain to go up
                    or down.
                    This problem would be solved by drawing two arrows (one up and one down) on the white piece that
                    hides the
                    wires, which would allow you to automatically understand which of the wires to use.
